# SIADS 696 Winter 2023 Team12 Soccer Player Recommender System and League Results Prediction

## Introduction

In the soccer world, there are a lot of players joining and leaving teams during the transfer windows. Players’ attributes and abilities certainly play a critical role in determining the teams’ results. However, team dynamics are equally important when all players have to work together to outscore their opponents. With that, signing high quality players at high costs does not always guarantee satisfactory results. We want to know how teams can find their “missing puzzle” to achieve their goals.

### Problem

The problem we are trying to solve is:
1. How to predict similar players for replacement when a player is sold or leaves the team?
2. What is the team dynamic look with different team players composition?
3. How to predict the team ranks in their respective league based on player attributes and dynamics?
